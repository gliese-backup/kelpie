# Learnings

API: To get some data, we used the dogs api
rules:
to get data we used fetch
i. will delay (.then and promises)
ii. errors will come (catch)

1. Promise? It means a future value
2. Async? Means parallel and non-blocking action
3. To work with promises we use .then and .catch
4. The fetch function gives us a promise
5. What we return from .then, we can use in another nested .then

# Steps

0. Basics of Network Requests: takes time & errors might occur
   i. We can use fetch to get some data
   ii. To work with async code we use Promises (JS Feature)
   iii. JSON parse (to read and convert) res.json()
   iv. To work with promises we use .then and .catch
   v. The fetch function gives us a Promise
1. We explored the dogs api which includes several endpoints
2. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Create Get
3. Explored the vite bundler
4. Difference b/w npm vs pnpm vs yarn
5. `pnpm create vite@latest .` (in our current directory)
   Vanilla with JavaScript
   Scaffold (basic project)
6. `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies
7. `pnpm run dev` to start the development sever
8. Remove unnessary files from the default Scaffold
9. Create structure with newcss
10. Create get dog breed function using fetch and .then
